# Slides â€” Digital Accountability

This folder contains a set of HTML slides and a `player.html` file that can be used to view them in sequence in your browser.

## Quick start (double-click)
- Open the `slides-digital-accountability` folder in File Explorer.
- Double-click `player.html` to open it in your default browser.

## Using VS Code Live Server
If you use Visual Studio Code, the Live Server extension provides a quick way to serve files:

1. Install the "Live Server" extension.
2. Open this folder in VS Code and open `player.html`.
3. Right-click inside the editor and choose "Open with Live Server" or click "Go Live" at the bottom-right.
4. Your browser will open; ensure the URL ends with `/player.html`.

## Keyboard / mouse controls
- Use the arrow keys or on-screen controls (if present) to navigate between slides.
- If speaker notes or embedded media are present, make sure your browser allows autoplay or click to start media.

## Troubleshooting
- Blank page or missing slides: Run a live server as described above.
- 404 when loading slide files: Confirm all `.html` slide files (e.g. `1.html`, `2.html`, ...) are present in the same folder as `player.html`.
- CORS / mixed content errors: Serve over HTTP (not `file://`) to avoid these issues.

## License / Attribution
These slides were created for a course or presentation. Keep any attribution present in the files.
